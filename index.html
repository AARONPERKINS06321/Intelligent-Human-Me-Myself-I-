  <p class="mb-4 text-rose-700">Are You Ready for a Love Story Worthy of a Website?</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-rose-700">Greetings, curious internet traveler!<br>
  If you’re reading this, fate—and possibly Google—has brought you here for a reason. My name is Aaron, and yes, I built this website because the universe clearly needed a place where the last genuine romantic on earth could hang his digital hat.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-rose-700">Let’s just get this out of the way: I’m not here to “Netflix and chill.” I’m here to Picnic and Thrill. I don’t want to “just see where things go.” I want to drive this thing like a rented convertible on the Amalfi Coast—with you riding shotgun, hair blowing, laughter filling the air, and at least three wrong turns because I ignored Google Maps (again).</p>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-rose-800 mt-6 mb-3">About Me:</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4 text-rose-700">
    <li>Tall enough to reach the top shelf (you’re welcome, cereal boxes everywhere).</li>
    <li>House-trained and capable of complex domestic tasks, like cooking an edible dinner or remembering to water plants before they look like extras in The Walking Dead.</li>
    <li>Romantically ambitious: My love language is all five love languages, plus a couple I made up myself, including “excessive breakfast-in-bed” and “random dance parties in the kitchen.”</li>
    <li>My friends say I’m the human version of a golden retriever—loyal, affectionate, occasionally goofy, but always up for an adventure or a nap (bonus points if you like both).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-rose-800 mt-6 mb-3">What Am I Looking For?</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4 text-rose-700">
    <li>A partner in crime (the legal, non-Netflix docuseries kind), someone who thinks life is better when shared.</li>
    <li>Someone who’ll jump on a plane with me, or—if that’s too much—a spontaneous midnight road trip for pancakes.</li>
    <li>Someone who believes love should be celebrated: with dinners, with trips, with handwritten notes left in shoes, with “just because” flowers and surprise serenades (you sing, I’ll clap off-beat).</li>
    <li>Someone who understands that life is a bit ridiculous and love is the best joke of all (I promise to keep the dad jokes under control…ish).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-rose-800 mt-6 mb-3">What Makes Me the Best Catch Ever?</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4 text-rose-700">
    <li>I don’t ghost—unless it’s Halloween and I’m in full bedsheet regalia.</li>
    <li>My idea of romance is more “surprise trip to Paris” than “text you back eventually.”</li>
    <li>I believe every woman should be loved loudly—with affection, respect, and possibly a lifetime supply of forehead kisses.</li>
    <li>I’ll never say “I told you so.” (I will think it, but my face is very subtle.)</li>
    <li>I’m basically a walking rom-com hero, minus the overdone hair gel and with 100% more willingness to do dishes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-rose-800 mt-6 mb-3">Why Build a Whole Website?</h3>
  <p class="mb-4 text-rose-700">Because the woman I’m looking for deserves a grand gesture—and, let’s face it, swiping left on me would be a tragedy for us both.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-rose-700">So if you’re ready for real love, relentless laughter, and a life full of unforgettable moments, let’s make our own story—the kind you tell your grandkids (or at least the kind you humble-brag about at brunch).</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-rose-700">So what do you say? Ready to be loved, cherished, and whisked away—one corny joke at a time?</p>
