    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA uses a dashboard-first approach. It opens with a high-level summary (donut chart, key metrics) to provide immediate context on the severity of the findings. Below this, an interactive "Strategy Explorer" section uses a filterable card-based grid to present each of the 17 signs. This allows for non-linear exploration. Clicking a card dynamically populates a "Detailed Evidence" section at the bottom, providing a seamless drill-down experience without page reloads. This structure was chosen to make a dense, text-heavy report scannable, engaging, and easy to digest for legal and clinical professionals, prioritizing key findings first and offering evidence on demand. -->

                    <p>Parental alienation (PA) is a complex and deeply damaging phenomenon occurring within the context of high-conflict divorce or separation. It describes a situation where children are encouraged by one parent (the favored parent) to unjustly reject the other parent (the targeted parent). This rejection is not based on the child's actual experiences but rather on the emotional manipulation exerted by the favored parent. The specific actions and behaviors utilized by the favored parent to achieve this outcome are termed parental alienation strategies.</p>
                    <p>This analysis is based on Dr. Amy J. Baker's extensive research, which has identified seventeen primary parental alienation strategies. It is imperative to distinguish parental alienation from legitimate estrangement, where a child's rejection is based on valid reasons such as substantiated abuse or neglect. A definitive identification of PA requires a comprehensive, multi-faceted assessment by a qualified professional, typically using Dr. Baker's five-factor model: (1) rejection of the parent, (2) a prior positive relationship, (3) absence of abuse by the rejected parent, (4) use of alienation strategies by the favored parent, and (5) exhibition of alienation behaviors by the child.</p>
                     <p>This interactive report focuses primarily on documenting Factor 4—the behaviors of Ms. Candace Perkins as documented in OurFamilyWizard communications—against Dr. Baker's 17 strategies. It serves as a tool to visualize and explore the evidence presented in the case analysis.</p>

                { id: 1, name: 'Badmouthing the Targeted Parent', status: 'Strongly Evidenced', definition: 'Making persistent negative or frightening statements about the targeted parent to the children.', analysis: 'There is clear evidence that the mother has conveyed a defamatory narrative about the father to the children. During an April 13, 2025 visit, all three boys “engaged [the father] in a lengthy series of questions regarding allegations of abuse — specifically statements that [he] ‘beat’ Candace or ‘hit her often.’” After the father answered their questions, the children “refused to engage further” and “did not wish to be near [him]” due to believing he was violent. These extreme accusations did not originate from the children themselves; rather, they indicate that the mother (or someone aligned with her) told the boys that their father was physically abusive. Notably, the father observes that “false narratives are being reinforced without correction, despite private acknowledgments between Candace and me that these allegations are not accurate”. This suggests an active campaign of badmouthing.' },
                { id: 2, name: 'Limiting Contact with the Father', status: 'Strongly Evidenced', definition: 'Disrupting or reducing the child’s time and communication with the targeted parent, often in violation of agreements.', analysis: 'The mother has demonstrably impeded the father’s contact with the children. The father documents that he has “called [Candace’s] cell phone, texted [her] cell, emailed [her], and sent ... OFW messages”, and also tried contacting the boys directly, but “nobody responds at all — no matter what I do”. Additionally, evidence from the children’s messages shows contact was actively curtailed: for example, on March 22, 2025, Bronx texted his father, “Dad we love you and are safe. The constant messaging from you is giving me anxiety. I’m going to block you for the time being... Please stop.” This unusual directive from a child strongly implies that the mother supported or instructed such limitation of contact.' },
                { id: 3, name: 'Interfering with Communication', status: 'Strongly Evidenced', definition: 'Obstructing or monitoring the normal communication between the child and the targeted parent.', analysis: 'As noted above, the father’s messages went unanswered; Ms. Perkins would not answer phone calls and failed to respond to messages on multiple platforms. The father explicitly states “there’s no way I can get in touch with you at all” regarding both Ms. Perkins and the children. It’s also documented that even via the court-sanctioned OFW app, Ms. Perkins read messages from the father but chose not to reply. Taken together, these behaviors show a pattern of Ms. Perkins interfering with the father’s communications to the children and herself, depriving the father of normal contact and updates.' },
                { id: 4, name: 'Interfering with Symbolic Communication', status: 'Partially Evidenced', definition: 'Preventing the child from feeling connected to the targeted parent even when apart (e.g., forbidding photos, constant texts during other parent\'s time).', analysis: 'There are strong indications that Ms. Perkins kept the children psychologically tethered to her and distant from the father during his parenting time. In the April 13, 2025 OFW journal entry, the father reported that after discussing the false abuse allegations, “all three boys isolated themselves in Pierce’s room [and] refused to engage further” for the remainder of the visit. He “observed them comparing text messages on their phones and discussing their contents” while at his home, suggesting that the children were receiving input from their mother in real time during his visit. This interfered with their ability to emotionally engage with their father.' },
                { id: 5, name: 'Withdrawal of Love (Conditional Approval)', status: 'Partially Evidenced', definition: 'Making approval and affection conditional upon the child’s rejection of the other parent.', analysis: 'There is no direct quote of this; however, the children’s behavior suggests they may feel such pressure. Bronx’s message on March 22, 2025 telling his father he needs to stop contacting them because it’s causing “anxiety” and that he will block him hints that the child is fearful of the turmoil or disapproval that results when he engages with his dad. The children’s complete loyalty to the mother’s narrative points to an environment in which maternal approval is paramount and must be maintained by rejecting their father.' },
                { id: 6, name: 'Telling the Child that the Targeted Parent is Dangerous', status: 'Strongly Evidenced', definition: 'Convincing the child that the targeted parent poses a danger to them or others, often through fabricated stories of abuse.', analysis: 'The evidence strongly indicates that Ms. Perkins portrayed the father as dangerous. The most compelling example is the children’s belief that their father had routinely beaten their mother. During the April 13, 2025 visit, the boys queried the father about claims that he “beat” and “hit [their mother] often”, and afterward they avoided being near him out of apparent fear. This belief was a narrative implanted in them, as the father notes Candace herself had privately acknowledged these stories were not accurate.' },
                { id: 7, name: 'Forcing the Child to Choose Between Parents', status: 'Partially Evidenced', definition: 'Manipulating the child into overtly choosing the alienator over the targeted parent.', analysis: 'While there is no single event where a child is asked point-blank, the scenario suggests the children were made to choose. After the separation in March 2025, the boys have consistently aligned with Ms. Perkins to the exclusion of their father. For example, during the April 13, 2025 visit, they would not engage with him beyond confronting him with accusations. They essentially “chose” to stay emotionally with their mother’s narrative rather than interact with their father.' },
                { id: 8, name: 'Telling the Child that the Targeted Parent Does Not Love Them', status: 'Partially Evidenced', definition: 'Convincing the child that the targeted parent has rejected or doesn’t care about them.', analysis: 'The documents do not show a direct quote. However, the father, in an email on April 15, 2025, expressed concern about “what the children are hearing” and emphasized that “they deserve to know they are loved by both parents.” This statement strongly implies that the father feared the boys were being led to believe he no longer cared, possibly by Ms. Perkins framing his move from the family home as him "leaving" them.' },
                { id: 9, name: 'Confiding in the Child (Inappropriate Adult Information)', status: 'Strongly Evidenced', definition: 'Sharing details of adult matters (divorce, finances, accusations) with the child to gain sympathy and alliance.', analysis: 'The clearest example is the domestic violence narrative. The children were clearly told about serious allegations of abuse – that their father had beaten their mother repeatedly. This is highly adult content, yet it was directly imparted to the children who then felt compelled to interrogate their father about it. By telling the boys “your father hit me,” Ms. Perkins essentially made them her protectors and allies in a very adult situation, a textbook instance of this strategy.' },
                { id: 10, name: 'Forcing the Child to Reject the Targeted Parent', status: 'Strongly Evidenced', definition: 'Creating situations where the child is compelled to actively reject the targeted parent.', analysis: 'There are multiple instances. One striking example is Bronx’s message telling his father that he will be blocking him and to cease contact. It is highly unusual for a child to take such an extreme step without external influence. Another example occurred during the April 13, 2025 visit: after confronting their father, all three boys collectively refused to spend time with him for the rest of the scheduled visit, an enactment of rejection.' },
                { id: 11, name: 'Asking the Child to Spy on the Targeted Parent', status: 'Absent', definition: 'Encouraging the child to gather information from the targeted parent’s home or conversations and report back.', analysis: 'The provided materials do not show instances of the mother explicitly using the children to spy on their father. There were no references to the children being asked to check the father’s documents, electronics, or household for information. This sign appears absent from the available evidence.' },
                { id: 12, name: 'Asking the Child to Keep Secrets from the Targeted Parent', status: 'Strongly Evidenced', definition: 'Encouraging the child to withhold important information from the targeted parent.', analysis: 'On March 19, 2025, the father asked his son Pierce, “Where are you?” and the only response Pierce gave was, “Safe.” He would not disclose his location. This suggests that Pierce had been instructed not to tell his father their whereabouts. It was a calculated reassurance that gave no actual information, a textbook example of keeping secrets at the mother\'s behest.' },
                { id: 13, name: 'Referring to the Targeted Parent by First Name', status: 'Absent', definition: 'Stopping use of “Mom” or “Dad” and using the parent\'s first name to diminish their role.', analysis: 'There is no evidence of this. In all communications provided, the children address Mr. Perkins as “Dad” or “Daddy.” For example, Pierce wrote, “Dad I asked you to sell them please just sell them”. This specific sign of alienation is absent.' },
                { id: 14, name: 'Referring to a Stepparent as “Mom” or “Dad”', status: 'Absent', definition: 'Encouraging the child to call a new partner “Mom” or “Dad,” effectively replacing the targeted parent.', analysis: 'This is not applicable as there is no stepparent in the picture as of the evidence provided. Consequently, this tactic is not observed.' },
                { id: 15, name: 'Withholding Important Information', status: 'Strongly Evidenced', definition: 'Withholding medical, academic, or other important information and excluding the parent from documents.', analysis: 'The record shows a consistent pattern. In an OFW message, the father itemized multiple “unanswered parenting questions” that he had been asking for over five weeks with no response. These included fundamental concerns such as: “Who watches the boys when you are away? What are their current schedules...? When are their next school and sports events?” This is clear evidence of withholding critical information.' },
                { id: 16, name: 'Changing the Child’s Name', status: 'Absent', definition: 'Changing the child’s name to remove association with the targeted parent.', analysis: 'There has been no indication of any attempt to change the children’s names. They continue to be referred to as Pierce Perkins, Bronx Perkins, and Cade Perkins. This alienation tactic is absent.' },
                { id: 17, name: 'Cultivating Dependency & Undermining Authority', status: 'Strongly Evidenced', definition: 'Fostering excessive dependency on the alienator while subverting the targeted parent’s authority.', analysis: 'There is evidence that Ms. Perkins has undermined the father’s authority. On April 13, 2025, the children rejected his parental role by refusing to speak with him or eat the lunch he offered. Furthermore, Bronx’s message telling his father to stop contacting them and that he would block him is a direct challenge to the father’s authority coming from a child, something that would likely only occur if the mother’s authority has eclipsed the father’s completely.' },
